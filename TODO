TODO list as of zkt-0.96

general:
	Renaming of the tools to zkt-?? ? 

dnssec-zkt:
 feat	option to specify the key age as remaining lifetime
	(Option -i inverse age ?) As of v0.95 the key lifetime
	is stored at the key itself, so this could be possibly
	implemented without big effort(?).

dnssec-signer:
 feat	The tool depends on a directory structure
	
 bug	There is no online checking of the key material by design.
 	So the signer command checks the status of the key as they
	are represented in the file system and not in the zone.
	The dnssec maintainer is responsible for the lifeliness of the
	data in the hosted domain.
	In other words: It's highly recommended to use the
	option -r when you use dnssec-signer on a production zone.
	Then the time of propagation is (more or less) equal to the timestamp
	of the zone.db.signed file.

 feat	For security reasons the signing process shouldn't be run
 	on the master name server, or the master should be a hidden one.
	A mechanism for copying the signed zone to the production name
	server and reload the zone would be helpful

 bug	The max_TTL and Key_TTL parameter should be set to the value found
 	in the zone. A mechanism for setting up a dnssec.conf file for the
	zone specific TTL values is needed.

dki:
 feat	Use dynamic memory for dname in dki_t
