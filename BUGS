BUG and TODO list as of zkt-0.5

dnssec-zkt:
 *	option to specify the key age as remaining lifetime
	(Option -i inverse age ?)

dnssec-signer:
 *	The dnssec-signer tool is in highly experimental status
	and may not work as expected. Use it only in testing environments.

 *	The tool depends on a special directory structure
	
 *	Key generation will be done on information gathered in
	the filesystem, not in the zone. So the complete system will only
	work if we propagate all information immediately in the domain name system.
	In other words: It's highly reecommended to use the
	option -r if you use dnssec-signer on a live zone.
	Thus the propagation time is (more or less) equal the timestamp
	of the zone.db.signed file.

 *	Manpage for dnssec-signer missing

 *	dnssec-signer should be able to read the (secure) zone names and directories
	out of named.conf

 *	Currently the resigning interval and the dnssec-signer running interval
	has to be the same. Maybe it will be useful to call dnssec-signer more
	often (especially for pre-pulish key announcement).
	Then we have to make that interval known to the algorithm (Parameter
	running-interval in dnssec.conf?).

dki:
 *	Use of dynamic memory for dname in dki_t

zconf:
 *	Memory leak in load_config (strdup in CONF_STRING)
	(The memory will never be free'ed.)
