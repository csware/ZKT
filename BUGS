BUG and TODO list as of zkt-0.63

dnssec-zkt:
 feat	option to specify the key age as remaining lifetime
	(Option -i inverse age ?)
	Difficult to implement, because with such an option, we have to read
	local dnssec.conf files to get the correct key lifetime.

dnssec-signer:
 bug	A change of the child zsk does not trigger an resigning of the parent
	zone. This is because the keyset-, and dsset- files will be always freshly
	created. Thus the timestamp of the file is not an indicator for a key rollover.
	The alternative is to check the file content if it's changed (check against
	what?), but this is a time consuming process.

 feat	The tool depends on a directory structure
	
 bug	Key generation will be done on information gathered in
	the filesystem, not in the zone. So the complete system will only
	work if we propagate all information immediately in the domain name system.
	In other words: It's highly recommended to use the
	option -r when you use dnssec-signer on a production zone.
	Then the time of propagation is (more or less) equal the timestamp
	of the zone.db.signed file.

 feat	For security reasons the signing process shouldn't be run on the master
	name server.
	Currently there is no mechanism to copy the signed zone to the production
	name server and reload the zone there.

dki:
 feat	Use dynamic memory for dname in dki_t

zconf:
 bug	Memory leak in load_config (strdup in CONF_STRING)
	(The memory will never be free'ed.)
zone:
 bug	Problem freeing memory occupied by load_config (see zone_free())
