.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I dnssec-zkt
command is a wrapper around
.I dnssec-keygen(8)
to assist in dnssec zone key management.
.PP
In the common usage the command prints out information about
all dnssec (zone) keys found in the given (or predefined default) directory.
It's also possible to specify keyfiles (K*.key) as arguments.
With option
.B \-r
subdirectories will be searched recursively, and all dnssec keys found
will be listed sorted by domain name, key type and generation time.
In that mode the use of the
.B \-p
option may be helpful to find the location of the keyfile in the directory tree.
.PP
Other forms of the command print out keys in a format suitable for
a trusted-key section or as a DNSKEY resource record.
.PP
The command is also useful in dns key management.
It allows key livetime monitoring and status change.

.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c " file"
Read default values from the specified config file.
Otherwise the default config file is read or build in defaults
will be used.
.TP
.B \-d
Skip directory arguments.
This will be useful in combination with wildcard arguments
to prevent dnsssec-zkt to list all keys found in subdirectories. 
For example "dnssec-zkt -d *" will give a list of all keys found only in
the current directory.
Maybe its easier to use "dnssec-zkt ." instead.
The option works similar to the \-d option of
.IR ls(1) .
.TP
.B \-k
Select and print key signing keys only (default depends on command mode).
.TP
.B \-z
Select and print zone signing keys only (default depends on command mode).
.TP
.B \-r
Recursive mode (default is off).
.br
Also settable in the dnssec.conf file (Parameter: Recursion).
.TP
.B \-p
Print pathname in listing mode.
In -C mode, create the new key in the same directory as (already existing)
keys with the same label.
.TP
.B \-a
Print age of key in weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds (default is off).
.br
Also settable in the dnssec.conf file.
.TP
.B \-t
Print key generation time (default is on).
.br
Also settable in the dnssec.conf file.
.TP
.B \-h
No header or trusted-key section header and trailer in -T mode
.PP

.SH COMMAND OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-H
Print out the online help.
.TP
.B \-T
List all key signing keys as a
.I named.conf
trusted-key section.
Use
.B \-h
to supress the section header/trailer.
.TP
.B \-K
List the public part of all the keys in DNSKEY resource record format.
Use
.B \-h
to suppress comment lines.
.TP
.BI \-C " zone"
Create a new zone signing key for the given zone.
Add option
.B \-k
to create a key signing key.
The key algorithm and key length will be examined from built-in default values
or from the parameter settings in the
.I dnssec.conf
file.
.br
Unless the
.B \-p
option is specified, the keyfile will be created in the current directory.
.TP
.BI \-R " keyid"
Remove the key with the given keyid.
The keyid is the numeric keytag with an optionally added zone name separated by a colon.
Beware that this deletes both private and public keyfiles, thus the key is
unrecoverable lost.
.TP
.BI \-P|A|D " keyid"
Change the status of the given dnssec key to
pre-published
.RB ( \-P ),
active
.RB ( \-A )
or depreciated
.RB ( \-D ).
The
.I keyid
is the numeric keytag with an optionally added zone name separated by a colon.
Setting the status to "pre-publish" or "depreciate" will change the filename
of the private key file to ".published" or ".depreciated" respectivly.
This prevents the usage of the key as a signing key by the use of
.IR dnssec-signzone(8) .
The time of status change will be stored in the 'mtime' field of the corresponding
".key" file.
Key activation via option
.B \-A
will restore the original timestamp and file name (".private").
.TP
.B \-Z
Write all config parameters to stdout.
The output is suitable as a template for the
.I dnssec.conf
file, so the easiest way to create a
.I dnssec.conf
file is to redirect the standard output of the above command.
Pay attention not to overwrite an existing file.

.SH SAMPLE USAGE
.TP 
.fam C
.B "dnssec-zkt -r . 
.fam T
Print out a list of all zone keys found below the current directory.
.TP
.fam C
.B "dnssec-zkt -Z -c """"
.fam T
Print out the compiled in default parameters.
.TP
.fam C
.B "dnssec-zkt -C example.net -k -p -r ./zonedir
.fam T
Create a new key signing key for the zone "example.net".
Store the key in the same directory below "zonedir" where the other
"example.net" keys live.
.TP
.fam C
.B "dnssec-zkt -T ./zonedir/example.net
.fam T
Print out a trusted-key section containing the key signing keys of "example.net".
.TP
.fam C
.B "dnssec-zkt -D 123245 -r . 
.fam T
Depreciate the key with tag "12345" below the current directory,

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /var/named/dnssec.conf
Global configuration file.
.TP
.I ./dnssec.conf
Local configuration file (only used in
.B \-C
mode).

.SH BUGS
.PP
Some of the general options will not be meaningful in all of the command modes.
